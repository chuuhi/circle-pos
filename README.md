A minimal point-of-sale system focused on backend order tracking.

Named as a playful contrast to Square POS (used at my job), this project explores a feature I wished existed: preserving item edit history instead of overwriting orders so kitchens can see what changed and when.

Built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Order changes are stored in a relational database and exposed through REST APIs, which I tested using Postman.

Longer term, I plan to extend Circle POS with payments, authentication, and loyalty tracking to mirror the real POS systems I’ve worked with and deepen my understanding of production-level backend systems.
